Notes for presentation:


"Where are your libraries?"
Do not get confused with Roxy's data paths.
- Explain the difference.

When you install a package, by default, it will go to your users library.
Be aware of: Computer at home - shared computer. Sharing computers in a lab at varsity.
If you change your user, things can happen.


"Packages contain a standard set of items"
"Dependancies" are packages that this package uses.


"How to get packages?"
CRAN repo. lots of them hosted at universities around the world.
Thats why the list is long - you can choose any, they are all the same. only speed might change.


"Functions"
In STATA / SAS / other language, there are things called functions, but named something else...


"A word about environment"
In the plotting lectures, the concept of an environment will become crucial


"Arguments"
Packages come from many different sources, so there is no one standard convention for naming schemas (in arguments for example).
Students need to understand the difference between this and (for example) Matlab - where one body decides conventions.
